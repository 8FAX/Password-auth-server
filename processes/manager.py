# this was the part of the original idea of the project, but it was not implemented. At the moment i am thinking i will
# implement it in the future, but dont know what role it will play in the project.
# i may scrap it all together. and use a cleaner process that will clean the data before it is stored in the database.
# it could also have helper functions that will help with the data processing. unsure at the moment. as no need to have a processes folder 
# if it is not going to be used for more then one thing.

# the idea for this can be found in the README.md file.
